# Paris Attacks
## How The World Searched For The Paris Attacks

This is an interactive visualization showing how different cities searched to find out what happend in Paris on Nov 13th.

### Design elements
Each of the 12 circles represents a city color-coded to tie together its location on the world map, the time on the timeline, and the questions asked by each city. The questions are represented as a tree appearing when a person taps on a circle. transparency "halos" around the circles are reminiscent of how information spreads. Something like radio waves spread. When a person taps on a city, the timeline is animated with a line traveling from Paris to that city.

The timeline starts at the point when Paris was attacked at 21:20 local time and ends at 00:58 when the attacks ended. By this time the news has traveled around the world which is represented by the globe icon. The icon of a person searching on their phone conveys the idea that no one expected this and everyone rushed to tried to make sense of what happened.

The high-contrast color scheme alludes to the sadness around the events punctuated with bright islands of hope as people attempted to understand, empathize, and react to the events.

### Methodology
First minute searched is defined as the first minute where a related search to Paris attacks showed up, starting at 21:18 Central European Time.
